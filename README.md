# Online Chat Room
In this project, I created a chatroom page where people can chat with each other.

**Tech used: DOM manipulation/ Server communication**

In this chatroom, you can create a text input and send it to the server. It will also retrieve the latest 50 messages from the server every 3 seconds.

Another feature is the chat box will scroll down to the bottom automatically, so you can always see the latest messages.

The UI is shown below.
